# MCP TERMINAL SERVER (EASY IMPLEMENTATION)
# -----------------------------
# subprocess is a standard Python module that lets us start new programs and
# interact with them (send input, read output). Think of it as opening a new
# terminal tab from inside your Python code to run a command like `ls` or
# `echo hello` and capture whatever text the command prints.

# will show up in client UIs.
