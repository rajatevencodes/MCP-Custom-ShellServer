# MCP TERMINAL SERVER (EASY IMPLEMENTATION)
# -----------------------------
# subprocess is a standard Python module that lets us start new programs and
# interact with them (send input, read output). Think of it as opening a new
# terminal tab from inside your Python code to run a command like `ls` or
# `echo hello` and capture whatever text the command prints.

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import subprocess

# Create the MCP server instance. "terminal_server" is just a short name that
# will show up in client UIs.
mcp = FastMCP("terminal_server")


# The @mcp.tool() decorator tells the MCP SDK that this function should be
# exposed to clients as a callable "tool" named play_with_terminal.
@mcp.tool()
def play_with_terminal(command: str) -> str:

    Parameters
    ----------
    command : str

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The text printed by the command (stdout) or, if the command fails,
        the error text (stderr).
